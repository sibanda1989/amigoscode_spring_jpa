# Spring Boot JPA

In this repository I document code as I learn Spring Boot JPA from Amigos Code through his [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SGDpanrc8U&t=2093s).

## Design Diagram
The project is developed using the 3-tier principle which has the following layers:

- Presentation Layer - this is the user interface layer. Main purpose is to present data, and/or interact with the end-user.
- Service Layer - also called Business/Application Layer. This is where the information obtained from user is processed using Business Logic.
- Data Access Layer - this is where information processed by the application is stored, usually in form of a relational database.

The following diagram illustrates this architecture:
